# Cards

The game should be able to run at the very least, a game of Bridge, communicating with the other computers neccessairy

## To-Do
- Add the logic behind shuffling cards and dealing them out to all the players
- Enable the game so that bidding can happen, and then a dummy hand be revealed
- Make the computers talk to each other 
- Based on the above, possibly a chat system
- Obviously, the actual game

### Footnotes
- Perhaps we want to try a simpler multiplayer game and get that to work before attempting bridge; we can always allow the final project to have multiple games anyway
- Oliver is here for general moral support, to provide drinks and take credit at the end
